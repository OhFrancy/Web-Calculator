Simple web calculator, made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, takes only 2 INPUTS. Made with only basic knowledge and learning in the making process, everything was done without looking for solutions but only basic terms and functions. It is an unpolished version and has many bugs, if you can care to report them, do it please.

Encouraging every negative review.
