Simple web calculator, made with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, takes only 2 INPUTS. Made with only basic knowledge and learning in the making process, everything was done with only basic terms and functions knowledge. It is an unpolished version and has many bugs, if you can care to report them, do it please.

It's a plain html, CSS and JS code, to run it just put all of them in one folder and open the .html. 
(If you want to edit the code I personally recommend the live-server extension on VSCode).
Following is a small list of what I learned thanks to this project:

Learnt most of javascript features that are in this projects, how to link html with JS and CSS, how to change CSS Elements from JS, how to properly use high-level language features for arrays, how to throw custom errors, setTimeout() identifier, how to make on-hover elements in CSS, how to 'manage' a dozen of functions and 'properly' link them, so that they are not conflicting with each other etc...

Encouraging every negative review to help me grow, as always.
